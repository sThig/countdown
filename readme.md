# :hourglass: COUNTDOWN CLOCK

A javascript project by [Wes Bos's Javascript 30/30](https://javascript30.com/) - this is my 29th day with his lessons and the minute I feel like I've learned something, I get stumped again.  This was a fun project but very difficult to get everything.  If I had to write this on my own, I'd have a difficult time.

# TIL
* how to play with time, and how I know very little
* Math.round and parseInt felt a little more at home, at least I know why/how to use them
* with a form, you don't have to query select it, you can just grab `document.customForm.addEventListener('submit', function (e)` for instance
